# Tutorials

This is our repo for draft tutorials. We'll review them here and then upload to our [Resources](https://talkjs.com/resources/) site, which uses the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) platform.

## Notes

- Add your tutorial to a new folder
- Write tutorials in Markdown â€“ refer to Ghost's [reference guide](https://ghost.org/help/using-markdown/) for details
- Add images and GIFs to the same folder and mark where you want them to appear in the tutorial text (for example, with `!! <file_name>.jpg`)
